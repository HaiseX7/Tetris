# **HOW TO PLAY (Tetris)**





## Goal



Stack falling blocks to complete full horizontal lines.

When a line is filled, it clears and you earn points.

If new pieces can’t spawn because the stack is too high, it’s Game Over.





## Controls (In-Game)



#### Move

Left Arrow → Move piece left

Right Arrow → Move piece right

Down Arrow → Soft drop (move down faster, one step per press)

D → Hard drop (instantly drops the piece to the lowest valid spot)



#### Rotate

Up Arrow → Rotate piece

If the rotation would collide, the game attempts a kick rotate (small auto shift to make it fit)



#### Pause

P → Pause the game



#### Quit

Q → Quit instantly (works in-game and in menus)





## Lock Delay (Important)

When your piece touches the ground, it doesn’t always lock immediately.

You have a short window to slide/rotate before it locks.

There’s also a hard “forced lock” timer so you can’t stall forever.

In your UI:

Red bar = normal lock delay

Blue bar = forced lock timer (absolute max time before the piece locks)
